# The project works, made with tkinter. Your DB set up looks very wise and complex. 
# 
# The idea is usefull and I see you put a lot of effort making GUI. Here is some points to improve:
# - You extablished the connection 5-6 times within one project and even twise within one class. 
# This is not really efficient. Ideally we want to have one connection. It could be a function which you could reuse several times if you need. 
# Also, look at using .env for hiding passwords and all. 

# - some parts of your GUI don't work entirely :) Like, select is not really select. So look at it!

# Very well done, overall!
